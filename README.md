# The RedDirector
Welcome to "The RedDirector", a simple yet lifesaving Chrome extension for all of you who, like me, have been bamboozled by Reddit's latest UI experiment.

# What's This All About?
Let's face it: change is hard. Especially when your favorite website decides to "test" a new interface on you without asking. That's exactly what Reddit did. And honestly? Not a fan. So, I put my coding gloves on and created this nifty little extension in JavaScript. Its mission? To redirect you away from the new, "ugly" Reddit UI and back to the good ol' new.reddit.com that we know and love.

# No Frills, Just Function
"The RedDirector" is all about simplicity. Currently, there's no GUI — it's a straightforward tool that does its job without any bells and whistles. You add it to Chrome, and it just works, silently taking you back to familiar Reddit territory.

# How to Use
Even if you're not tech-savvy, fret not! Here's how to get this extension up and running:

1. Clone the directory using your Operating System's command line:
```
git clone https://github.com/JoelCreates/Reddit-Redirector-For-Chrome.git
```
3. Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/.
4. Enable 'Developer mode' at the top right corner.
5. Click 'Load unpacked'.
6. Select the folder where you cloned "The RedDirector".
7. Enjoy Reddit as it was meant to be enjoyed!
